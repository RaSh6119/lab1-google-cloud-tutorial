# Lab1 - Complete QwikLabs tour of Google Cloud Platform

You should access the QwikLabs tour and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
overview at [https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/2794?parent=catalog](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/2794?parent=catalog).

This lab should be very easy -- you're basically following an online
tutorial to learn how to use a software platform. 

After finishing that exercise, complete this one: 
[https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/563?parent=catalog](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/563?parent=catalog).
This will require a QwikLabs credit. Info on how to utilize credits will be
provided in class.

Some additional
challenges will be that you're going to be accepting this lab through
Github Classroom and submitting your solution using git.

At the end of the second lab, edit a file called test.txt.  Write your name into that file.  
Then, in the gcloud shell run "cat test.txt" and take a screen shot.

You should name your image something like
"lab1-finish-YOURNAME.png". You should then modify this README.md to
display your image rather than the image I provided. This will
evaluate your ability to:

* Complete the Qwiklab on using Google cloud
* Accepting a Github Classroom assignment
* Checkout out a Git repo
* Adding a file to the staging (`git add your-file-name.png`)
* Updating a Markdown file
* Commiting your changes (`git commit -a -m'your message here'`)
* Pushing the changes to Github (`git push`)
